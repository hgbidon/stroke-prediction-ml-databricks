# ü©∫ Stroke Prediction ML Project (Databricks)

## üìò Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of stroke in patients using demographic and clinical data.  
It was built entirely on **Databricks**, leveraging **PySpark, Scikit-Learn, SMOTE**, and **Plotly** for model training, class balancing, and inline visualization ‚Äî without external dashboards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Environment:** Databricks Community Edition  
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, PySpark, Plotly, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Modeling:** RandomForest, Logistic Regression  
- **Feature Engineering:** One-hot encoding, SMOTE balancing, risk bucketing  
- **Visualization:** Plotly interactive charts, inline Databricks dashboards  
- **MLOps Tools:** MLflow model logging, exportable `.pkl` models

## üß† Key Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and encoded categorical variables (`gender`, `smoking_status`, `work_type`, etc.)
- Applied **SMOTE** to balance the dataset between stroke and non-stroke cases.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Built **Logistic Regression** and **RandomForest** models.
- Achieved **ROC-AUC = 0.775** with balanced recall for positive class.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance
- Top predictors: `age`, `avg_glucose_level`, `bmi`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Inline Databricks Dashboard
- Accuracy & ROC metrics table  
- Probability distribution by class  
- Confusion matrix heatmap  
- Feature importance ranking  
- Risk segmentation and demographic breakdowns  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment (Optional)
- Logged via **MLflow** with preprocessing encoders.
- Ready for downstream deployment or API integration.
